Wow, okay, where do I start? Just got out of The Parenting, and my head's all sorts of jumbled, like a seismic survey gone wrong. Sitting here on the bench, feel like I should be sipping coffee but all I've got are popcorn crumbs clinging to my jeans. The theater noise still echoes in my ears, a cacophony of credits rolling and people shuffling — kinda like tectonic plates clashing but, you know, with more chit-chat.

So the movie. It's like a landslide of emotions and scenes that crash together — sometimes smooth like sandstone, other times jagged like quartzite. There was this one moment where the parent, that dad with the hair like a sedimentary rock formation — what's his name again? Jeff? Jess? Anyway, he's just standing there, looking at his kid with eyes as deep as a mine shaft, and you can almost feel the weight of unspoken words, like layers of rock pressing down over millennia.

I swear my back's hurting like I spent hours hunched over a rock sample. Probably need a new seat... or a new back. Lol. Oh, and that scene where the mom is making eggs — suddenly I’m thinking of how lava flows slowly, unpredictably, over the landscape, and that's just like her temper, isn't it? She cracks the egg like she’s expecting to find a geode inside. Wild.

> Okay, and I laughed more times than I can count, but it's the kind of laughter that leaves you a little disoriented, like when you find an unexpected fault line in your research data. I mean, that teenager — holy granite, the sass! Reminds me of those pesky blips on a seismograph when you're sure it's the real deal but it's just noise.

Oh yeah, someone asked if they could download the movie or watch the movie later. Should probably text them back. Ah, who is it again? Must be my mind slipping through the cracks like water through porous pumice. 

Anyway, if you can, check it out — it’s like trying to decipher a geological map at first glance, but once you get the hang of it, you see the fault lines and beauty in the mess. Okay, I think that doesn’t even make sense anymore. Brain's fried, and I’m seeing rock analogies everywhere.
